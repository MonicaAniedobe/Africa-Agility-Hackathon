This repository contains the data report and insights generated during the **Africa Agility Hackathon (March â€“ April 2025)**. Our team worked on **FarmFood Hub**, a platform aimed at reducing food waste and improving food distribution access by connecting farmers, consumers, NGOs, and food banks across Africa.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

During the hackathon, I joined the **Data Analytics team**, where we analyzed survey responses from over **200 participants across 10 African countries** using **Power BIand Google sheet**. The goal was to uncover consumer and farmer challenges around food access and inform product development decisions for FarmFood Hub.
